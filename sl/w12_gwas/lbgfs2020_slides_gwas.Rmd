```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, results = "asis")
knitr::knit_hooks$set(hook_convert_odg = rmdhelp::hook_convert_odg)
```

## Motivation

* Want to find location of important "genes"
* Draft of complete sequence of Human genome in 2000
* Function of different regions of genomes not known for large parts

$\rightarrow$ Associate locations in the genome with function


## Association

```{r conserved-marker-segment, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = 'odg/conserved-marker-segment.odg')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/conserved-marker-segment.png")
```


## Single Marker Regression Tests

\begin{equation}
y = Wb + Xg + e
\end{equation}


## Genome-Wide Association Experiments Using Haplotypes

* Haplotypes as groups of SNP 


## Fitting All Markers Simultaneously

$$y = 1^T \mu + Xg + e$$
