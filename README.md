Welcome to the website of

  - [751-6305-00L Livestock Breeding and
    Genomics](http://www.vorlesungsverzeichnis.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lang=en&lerneinheitId=140169&semkez=2020W&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&)

## Topics for Master Theses

Topics for Master Theses at Qualitas AG together with ETH will be shown
soon.

## Description

Methods for analysing livestock data, in particular for the estimation
of breeding values: principles of selection index, introduction to BLUP,
application of common models used, relationship matrix, methods for the
estimation of variance components, basics of breeding programs. The
material will be illustrated via exercises and assignments.
