Please find attached to this e-mail the pdf-version of the exam questions in Livestock Breeding and Genomics.
The exam starts at 09:15, please do not start with the exam ahead of time. If you have questions, you can ask them in the zoom-meeting for which you received an invitation. The exam is an open-book exam, but you are expected to solve the exam questions on your own. The exam ends at 11:15. After that you have time to send me all your solutions until 12:00.
I wish you all the best and good luck for the exam.
Best regards, Peter von Rohr
